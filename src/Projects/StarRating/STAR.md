# Star Rating Component in React

This project demonstrates how to build a reusable and dynamic Star Rating component in React. Users can click on stars to provide ratings, and the selected rating is displayed.

# Features:

1. Display a dynamic number of stars.

2. Allow users to select a rating by clicking on stars.

3. Highlight stars up to the selected rating.

4. Show the current rating below the stars.


# How It Works

1. State Management:
The rating state keeps track of the currently selected star.

2. Dynamic Rendering:
The stars are dynamically generated using Array(totalStars).

3. Event Handling:
Clicking on a star updates the rating state.

4. Styling:
Stars are highlighted dynamically based on the rating value.



# Enhancements

1. Hover Preview:

Highlight stars as the user hovers over them before clicking.

2. Custom Colors:

Allow users to customize the color of selected and unselected stars.

3. Half Stars:

Support fractional ratings (e.g., 3.5 stars).

4. Callback:

Provide a callback to the parent component to get the selected rating.

5. Read-Only Mode:

Add a mode where users can only view the rating but not interact.
